# RegPulse - Voice-First AI Compliance Monitor

**üèÜ Lovable Ditto Hackathon Submission**

## What are we building?

**Voice-first AI that flags regulatory risk on sales calls in real time and shows the exact rule with audit-ready evidence.**

## Problem Statement

Risky promises & pressure tactics slip through live calls and create regulatory exposure. Manual QA is slow/expensive; random sampling misses most issues.
